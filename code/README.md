## Task-03: Recommendation System (Code)

This folder contains the implementation of a **Content-Based Recommendation System** developed as part of **Task-03** of the Generative AI Internship at Prodigy InfoTech.

### 📌 File Description
- **Task_03_Recommendation_System.ipynb**  
  A Jupyter Notebook that implements a recommendation system using textual similarity.

### 🧠 Approach Used
- Created a sample dataset of items with textual descriptions
- Converted text data into numerical vectors using **TF-IDF Vectorization**
- Computed similarity scores using **Cosine Similarity**
- Generated recommendations based on highest similarity scores
- Saved the recommended results to an output file

### 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- TF-IDF Vectorizer
- Cosine Similarity

### 🎯 Objective
To understand and implement a basic recommendation system that suggests similar items based on content rather than user behavior.
